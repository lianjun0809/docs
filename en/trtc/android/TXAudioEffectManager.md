## enableVoiceEarMonitor

#### Enable ear return

After the host enables ear return, they can hear their own voice collected by the microphone in the headphones. This effect is suitable for scenarios where the host is singing.

It should be noted that due to the high hardware latency of Bluetooth headphones, this effect cannot be enabled when the host is wearing Bluetooth headphones. Please try to prompt the host to wear wired headphones in the user interface.

Also, please note that not all mobile phones can achieve excellent ear return effects after enabling this feature. We have blocked this effect for phones with poor ear return performance.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enable | true: on; false: off. |

> **Note**
> 

> This effect can only be enabled when the host is wearing headphones. Please also prompt the host to wear wired headphones.

## TXAudioMusicParam

#### Playback control information for background music

This information is used to specify background music details in the interface [startPlayMusic, including play ID, file path, loop count, etc.:

1. If you need to play the same background music multiple times, do not assign a new ID each time. We recommend using the same ID.

2. If you want to play different pieces of music simultaneously, assign different IDs for each piece.

3. If you use the same ID to play different music, the SDK will stop the old music before playing the new one.

| --- | --- |
| endTimeMS | [Field Meaning] Music play end time, in milliseconds. 0 means play until the end of the file. |
| id | [Field Meaning] Music ID. [Special Instructions] The SDK allows playing multiple music tracks simultaneously, so IDs are needed to control start, stop, volume, etc. |
| isShortFile | [Field Meaning] Whether the played file is a short music file. [Recommended Value] true: Requires repeating short music file; false: Normal music file. Default: false. |
| loopCount | [Field Meaning] The number of times the music loops. [Recommended Value] Value range is 0 to any positive integer. Default: 0. 0 means play the music once; 1 means play the music twice; and so on. |
