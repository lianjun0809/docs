## sharedInstance

#### Create a `TRTCCloud` Instance (Singleton Pattern)
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| context | Only applies to the Android platform. The SDK internally converts it to the Android platform's ApplicationContext to call Android System API. If the passed context parameter is NULL, the SDK will automatically obtain the current process's ApplicationContext. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. Using delete ITRTCCloud* will cause compilation errors. Please use destroyTRTCCloud to release the object pointer.
> 

> 2. On Windows, Mac, and iOS platforms, please call the getTRTCShareInstance() interface.
> 

> 3. On the Android platform, please call the getTRTCShareInstance(void *context) interface.
> 

## destroySharedInstance

#### Terminate `TRTCCloud` Instance (Singleton Pattern)

## addDelegate:

#### Add TRTC Event Callback

You can receive various event notifications from the SDK (such as error codes, warning codes, audio and video status parameters) through TRTCCloudDelegate.

## removeDelegate:

#### Remove TRTC Event Callback

## delegateQueue

#### Set the Queue for Driving TRTCCloudDelegate Event Callback

If you do not specify your own delegateQueue, the SDK will use the MainQueue as the default queue for driving TRTCCloudDelegate event callbacks.

When the delegateQueue property is not set, all callback functions in TRTCCloudDelegate are driven by the MainQueue.

> **Note**
> 

> If you specify your own delegateQueue, do not operate the UI within the TRTCCloudDelegate callback functions, as this will cause thread safety issues.
> 

## enterRoom:appScene:

#### Enter Room

All TRTC users must enter a room to "publish" or "subscribe" to audio and video streams. "Publish" means pushing your audio and video to the cloud, and "subscribe" means pulling audio and video streams from other users in the room from the cloud.

To call this interface, you need to specify your application scenario TRTCAppScene for the best audio and video transmission experience. These scenarios can be divided into two major categories:

**Real-time Call:**

Includes TRTCAppSceneVideoCall and TRTCAppSceneAudioCall as two options: video call and audio call. This mode is suitable for 1-on-1 audio and video calls or online meetings with up to 300 participants.

**Online Live Streaming:**

Includes TRTCAppSceneLIVE and TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom as two options: video live streaming and voice live streaming. This mode is suitable for online live streaming scenarios with up to 100,000 participants. However, you need to specify the **role** field in the TRTCParams parameter introduced later, distinguishing users in the room into two different roles: **Anchor** (TRTCRoleAnchor) and **Audience** (TRTCRoleAudience).

After calling this interface, you will receive the onEnterRoom(result) callback from TRTCCloudDelegate:
-  If entering the room is successful, the result parameter will be a positive number (result > 0), indicating the time taken from the function call to entering the room, in milliseconds (ms).

-  If entering the room fails, the result parameter will be a negative number (result < 0), indicating the failure [Error Code](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/32257).

| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| param | Room entry parameters are used to specify the user's identity, role, and security token information. For details, please refer to TRTCParams. |
| scene | Application scenario parameters are used to specify your business scenario. All users in the same room need to set the same TRTCAppScene. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. All users in the same room need to set the same scene. Different scenes can occasionally lead to anomalies.
> 

> 2. When you set the parameter scene to TRTCAppSceneLIVE or TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom, you must use the "role" field in TRTCParams to set the role of the current user in the room.
> 

> 3. Please ensure that enterRoom and exitRoom are paired before and after use, i.e., ensure "exit the previous room before entering the next room," otherwise, many anomalies may occur.
> 

## exitRoom

#### Leave Room

Calling this interface will make the user leave the audio and video room they are in and release resources such as the camera, microphone, and speaker.

After the resources are released, the SDK will notify you through the TRTCCloudDelegate callback in onExitRoom.

If you want to call enterRoom again or switch to another provider's SDK, it is recommended to wait for the onExitRoom callback before performing subsequent operations to avoid camera or microphone occupation issues.

## switchRole:

#### Switch Role

This interface allows users to switch between the roles of `Anchor` and `Audience`.

Since video streaming and voice chat rooms need to support up to 100,000 viewers simultaneously, the rule is set that **only anchors can publish their audio and video**. Therefore, if some audience members wish to publish their audio and video streams (to interact with the anchors), they need to switch their role to **Anchor** first.

When entering a room, you can predefine the user's role using the role field in TRTCParams, or dynamically switch roles after entering the room using the switchRole interface.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| role | Role, defaults to **Anchor**. - TRTCRoleAnchor: Anchor, can publish their own audio and video. A maximum of 50 anchors can simultaneously publish audio and video in the same room. - TRTCRoleAudience: Audience, cannot publish their own audio and video streams, can only view audio and video of other anchors in the room. To publish their own audio and video, they need to switch to **Anchor** via the switchRole interface. A maximum of 100,000 audience members can be accommodated in the same room. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. This interface is only applicable to video live streaming (TRTCAppSceneLIVE) and voice chat room (TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom) scenarios.
> 

> 2. If the scene specified in enterRoom is TRTCAppSceneVideoCall or TRTCAppSceneAudioCall, do not call this interface.
> 

## switchRole:privateMapKey:

#### Switch Role (Supports Setting Permission Bit)

This interface allows users to switch between the roles of `Anchor` and `Audience`.

Due to video live streaming and voice chat rooms needing to support up to 100,000 viewers simultaneously, a rule has been established that "only the host can publish their own audio and video".

Therefore, when some viewers wish to publish their own audio and video streams (in order to interact with the host), they need to first switch their role to "host".

When entering a room, you can predefine the user's role using the role field in TRTCParams, or dynamically switch roles after entering the room using the switchRole interface.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| privateMapKey | Permission tickets are used for permission control. When you want to restrict a specific room to allow only specific userIds to enter or upload videos, you need to use privateMapKey for permission protection. -  It is recommended only for customers with high-level security requirements. For more details, please refer to [Enabling Advanced Permission Control](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/32240). |
| role | Role, defaults to "Anchor": - TRTCRoleAnchor: Anchor, can publish their own audio and video. A maximum of 50 anchors can simultaneously publish audio and video in the same room. - TRTCRoleAudience: Audience cannot publish their own audio and video streams and can only watch other anchors' audio and video in the room. If you want to publish your own audio and video, you need to switch to "Anchor" through switchRole. A maximum of 100,000 audience members can be accommodated in the same room. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. This interface is only applicable to video live streaming (TRTCAppSceneLIVE) and voice chat room (TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom) scenarios.
> 

> 2. If the scene specified in enterRoom is TRTCAppSceneVideoCall or TRTCAppSceneAudioCall, do not call this interface.
> 

## switchRoom:

#### Switch Room

This interface allows users to quickly switch from one room to another.
-  If the user's role is "Audience", the effect of calling this interface is equivalent to exitRoom (current room) + enterRoom (new room).

-  If the user's role is "Anchor", this interface will maintain the user's audio and video publishing status while switching rooms. As a result, the preview of the camera and the collection of sound will not be interrupted during the room switching process.

This interface is suitable for scenarios in online education where supervising teachers need to switch quickly between multiple rooms. In this scenario, using switchRoom can achieve better smoothness and less code volume compared to using exitRoom + enterRoom.

The interface call results will be returned through the onSwitchRoom(errCode, errMsg) callback in TRTCCloudDelegate.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config | For room parameters, please refer to TRTCSwitchRoomConfig. |

> **Note**
> 

> Due to the need for compatibility with older SDK versions, the config parameters contain both roomId and strRoomId. The specifications for filling these parameters are particularly important, so please take note of the following:
> 

> 1. If you choose strRoomId, then roomId needs to be set to 0. If both are filled, roomId will be selected by default.
> 

> 2. All rooms must either use strRoomId or roomId consistently. Mixing both will result in unexpected bugs.
> 

## connectOtherRoom:

#### Request Cross-room Communication

By default, only users within the same room can make audio and video calls. Audio and video streams in different rooms are isolated.

However, you can use this interface to publish the audio and video streams of a host in another room to your own room. At the same time, this interface will also publish your own audio and video streams to the target host's room.

In other words, you can use this interface to enable cross-room audio and video stream sharing between hosts in two different rooms, allowing audiences in each room to watch the audio and video streams of both hosts. This feature can be used to implement a PK feature between hosts.

The result of the cross-room communication request will be notified to you via the TRTCCloudDelegate callback onConnectOtherRoom.

For example, when Host A in room "101" establishes a cross-room call with Host B in room "102" using connectOtherRoom(),
-  users in room "101" will receive the onRemoteUserEnterRoom(B) and onUserVideoAvailable(B, YES) event callbacks for Host B, allowing users in room "101" to subscribe to Host B's audio and video streams.

-  users in room "102" will receive the onRemoteUserEnterRoom(A) and onUserVideoAvailable(A, YES) event callbacks for Host A, allowing users in room "102" to subscribe to Host A's audio and video streams.

To consider compatibility issues with subsequent extension fields, the parameters for cross-room communication temporarily use JSON format:

**Case 1: Numeric Room Number**

If Host A in room '101' wants to connect with Host B in room '102', Host A needs to pass in the following when calling the interface: {"roomId": 102, "userId": "userB"}

Below is the sample code:
``` objectivec
  NSMutableDictionaryjsonDict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
  [jsonDict setObject:@(102) forKey:@"roomId"];
  [jsonDict setObject:@"userB" forKey:@"userId"];
  NSData* jsonData = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:jsonDict options:NSJSONWritingPrettyPrinted error:nil];
  NSString* jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:jsonData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  [trtc connectOtherRoom:jsonString];
```

**Case 2: String Room Number**

If you are using a string room number, be sure to replace "roomId" in the JSON with "strRoomId": {"strRoomId": "102", "userId": "userB"}

Below is the sample code:
``` objectivec
  NSMutableDictionaryjsonDict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
  [jsonDict setObject:@"102" forKey:@"strRoomId"];
  [jsonDict setObject:@"userB" forKey:@"userId"];
  NSData* jsonData = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:jsonDict options:NSJSONWritingPrettyPrinted error:nil];
  NSString* jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:jsonData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  [trtc connectOtherRoom:jsonString];
```
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| param | You need to pass in a JSON-formatted string argument, where roomId represents the room number in numeric format, strRoomId represents the room number in string format, and userId represents the target broadcaster's user ID. |

## disconnectOtherRoom

#### Exit Cross-room Communication

The result of exiting will be notified to you via the TRTCCloudDelegate callback onDisconnectOtherRoom.

## setDefaultStreamRecvMode:video:

#### Set Subscription Mode (Needs to be set before entering the room to take effect)

You can switch between "auto-subscribe" and "manual subscribe" modes via this interface:
-  Automatic Subscription: Default mode where users receive audio and video streams from the room immediately after entering. Audio plays automatically and video starts decoding automatically (you still need to bind the rendering control through the startRemoteView interface).

-  Manual Subscription: After entering the room, users need to manually call the startRemoteView interface to start the subscription and decoding of the video stream and manually call the muteRemoteAudio (NO) interface to start audio playback.

In most scenarios, users entering a room will subscribe to all the audio and video streams from the broadcasters within that room. Therefore, TRTC defaults to an automatic subscription mode to achieve the best "instant start experience".

If your application scenario involves many audio and video streams being published in each room and each user only wants to selectively subscribe to 1-2 of them, it is recommended to use the "manual subscription" mode to save on bandwidth costs.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| autoRecvAudio | YES: Automatically subscribe to audio; NO: Manually call muteRemoteAudio(NO) to subscribe to audio. Default: YES. |
| autoRecvVideo | YES: Automatically subscribe to video; NO: Manually call startRemoteView to subscribe to video. Default: YES. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. This setting needs to be called before entering the room to take effect.
> 

> 2. In automatic subscription mode, if the user does not call startRemoteView to subscribe to the video stream after entering the room, the SDK will automatically stop subscribing to the video stream to save traffic.
> 

## createSubCloud

#### Create Sub-room Instances (For Multi-room Concurrent Viewing)

TRTCCloud was initially designed as a Singleton Pattern, limiting the ability to watch multiple rooms concurrently.

By calling this interface, you can create multiple TRTCCloud instances to watch audio and video streams from multiple rooms simultaneously.

However, please note that the ability to publish audio and video streams across multiple TRTCCloud instances is subject to certain restrictions.

This feature is primarily used in a business scenario called "super small class" in online education settings, aimed at addressing the limitation that "each TRTC room can only have up to 50 people broadcasting their audio and video streams simultaneously".

Below is the sample code:
``` objectivec
    //In the small room that needs interaction, enter the room as an anchor and push audio and video streams
    TRTCCloud *mainCloud = [TRTCCloud sharedInstance];
    TRTCParams *mainParams = [[TRTCParams alloc] init];
    //Fill your params
    mainParams.role = TRTCRoleAnchor;
    [mainCloud enterRoom:mainParams appScene:TRTCAppSceneLIVE)];
    //...
    [mainCloud startLocalPreview:YES view:videoView];
    [mainCloud startLocalAudio:TRTCAudioQualityDefault];

    //In the large room that only needs to watch, enter the room as an audience and pull audio and video streams
    TRTCCloud *subCloud = [mainCloud createSubCloud];
    TRTCParams *subParams = [[TRTCParams alloc] init];
    //Fill your params
    subParams.role = TRTCRoleAudience;
    [subCloud enterRoom:subParams appScene:TRTCAppSceneLIVE)];
    //...
    [subCloud startRemoteView:userId streamType:TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig view:videoView];
    //...
    //Exit from new room and release it.
    [subCloud exitRoom];
    [mainCloud destroySubCloud:subCloud];
```

> **Note**
> 
> -  The same user can enter multiple rooms with different roomIds using the same userId.
> -  Two different terminal devices cannot use the same userId to enter the same roomId simultaneously.
> -  You can set the TRTCCloudDelegate separately for different instances to receive their respective event notifications.
> -  The same user can stream on multiple TRTCCloud instances and call interfaces related to local audio and video in sub-instances. However, please note:
> -  The audio for multiple instances must be either microphone capture or custom data collection, and invoking interfaces related to audio devices will be based on the last call
> -  Calls related to the camera will take the last one as definitive: startLocalPreview.

#### Return value description:

Sub TRTCCloud instances

## destroySubCloud:

#### Terminate Sub-room Instances
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| subCloud | Sub-room instances |

## updateOtherRoomForwardMode:

#### Modify the uplink capability of cross-room broadcasters in this room

Usually, after calling the connectOtherRoom interface to conduct cross-room communication with another room's broadcaster, all viewers in this room will receive the audio and video stream published by that broadcaster.

You can call this interface to restrict the uplink capability of a cross-room broadcaster in this room, either forbidding or allowing them to publish audio/main video/auxiliary video. This action will affect all users in the room.

After disabling certain uplink capabilities of the cross-room broadcaster, all users in this room will not be able to receive the corresponding audio and video streams, nor will they be able to subscribe to them.

It should be noted that this interface can only be called by the broadcaster conducting cross-room communication, and the restrictions set through this interface will reset if the cross-room communication is interrupted or the corresponding broadcaster exits the room.

The result of this interface call will be notified to you through the onUpdateOtherRoomForwardMode callback in TRTCCloudDelegate.

For example:

In room "101", there is Host A and Audience B, while in room "102", there is Host C, who is normally publishing audio and video streams. Host A establishes a cross-room call with Host C using connectOtherRoom().
-  At this time, Host A and Audience B will receive three event callbacks for Host C: onRemoteUserEnterRoom(C), onUserVideoAvailable(C, YES), and onUserAudioAvailable(C, YES), allowing them to subscribe to Host C's audio and video.

Later, Host A calls this interface to disable Host C's ability to publish audio in the current room.
-  Afterward, Host C's audio stream will not be published to room "101". Host A and Audience B will receive the onUserAudioAvailable(C, NO) event callback and will no longer be able to subscribe to Host C's audio through muteRemoteAudio(C, NO).

-  Host C's video stream will not be affected. Other audience members in room "102" are also unaffected and can normally subscribe to Host C's audio.

To consider compatibility issues with subsequent extension fields, the parameters for this interface temporarily use JSON format. The example is as follows:

**Case 1: Numeric Room Number**
``` objectivec
{
  "roomId":102,
  "userId":"userC",
  "muteAudio":false,
  "muteVideo":true,
  "muteSubStream":false
}
```

**Case 2: String Room Number**
``` objectivec
{
  "strRoomId":"102",
  "userId":"userC",
  "muteAudio":false,
  "muteVideo":true,
  "muteSubStream":false
}
```
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| param | You need to pass in a JSON-formatted string argument where roomId represents the room number in numeric format, strRoomId represents the room number in string format, userId represents the target broadcaster's user ID. The options muteAudio, muteVideo, and muteSubStream denote whether to disable or allow the cross-room broadcaster to publish audio, main stream video, and sub-stream video respectively. |

## startPublishMediaStream:encoderParam:mixingConfig:

#### Start publishing media stream

This interface sends an instruction to the TRTC server to relay/transcode the current user's audio and video streams to the Live CDN or push them back into the TRTC room. You can specify the publishing mode through TRTCPublishTarget configuration and TRTCPublishMode
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config | Media stream transcoding configuration parameters. Refer to TRTCStreamMixingConfig for detailed configuration. This is required when transcoding and pushing back to the TRTC room. You need to specify your desired transcoding configuration parameters. It is invalid in relay mode. |
| params | Media stream encoding output parameters. Refer to TRTCStreamEncoderParam for detailed configuration. This is required when transcoding and pushing back to the TRTC room. You need to specify your desired transcoding output parameters. For better relay stability and CDN compatibility, it is also recommended to configure this during relay. |
| target | The target address for media stream publishing. Refer to TRTCPublishTarget for detailed configuration. Supports relay/transcoding to Tencent or third-party CDNs, and also supports transcoding pushback to the TRTC room. |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. The SDK will provide the task identifier (taskId) for the backend startup through the callback onStartPublishMediaStream.
> 

> 2. The same task (both TRTCPublishMode and TRTCPublishCdnUrl are identical) can only be started once. If you need to update or stop this task later, you must record and use the returned taskId to operate through updatePublishMediaStream or stopPublishMediaStream.
> 

> 3. The target supports configuring multiple CDN URLs simultaneously (up to 10). If the same relay/transcoding task needs to be published to multiple CDNs, you only need to configure multiple CDN URLs in the target. Even if there are multiple relay addresses for the same transcoding task, only one transcoding fee will be charged.
> 

> 4. When using, do not push multiple tasks to the same URL addresses simultaneously to avoid abnormal streaming status. A recommended scheme is to use "sdkappid_roomid_userid_main" in the URL as a distinguishing identifier. This naming convention is easy to recognize and will not cause conflicts in your multiple applications.
> 

## updatePublishMediaStream:publishTarget:encoderParam:mixingConfig:

#### Update the published media stream.

This interface will send directives to the TRTC server to update the media stream started by startPublishMediaStream
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config | Media stream transcoding configuration parameters. Refer to TRTCStreamMixingConfig for detailed configuration. This is required when transcoding and pushing back to the TRTC room. You need to specify your desired transcoding configuration parameters. It is invalid in relay mode. |
| params | Media stream encoding output parameters. Refer to TRTCStreamEncoderParam for detailed configuration. This is required when transcoding and pushing back to the TRTC room. You need to specify your desired transcoding output parameters. For better relay stability and CDN compatibility, it is also recommended to configure this during relay. |
| target | The target address for media stream publishing. Refer to TRTCPublishTarget for detailed configuration. Supports relay/transcoding to Tencent or third-party CDNs, and also supports transcoding pushback to the TRTC room. |
| taskId | It will provide you with the task identifier (i.e., taskId) for the background start task through the onStartPublishMediaStream callback |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. You can use this interface to update the published CDN URL (supports add and delete, up to 10 at the same time), but ensure you do not push multiple tasks to the same URL addresses simultaneously to avoid abnormal streaming status.
> 

> 2. You can update or adjust relay/transcoding tasks using taskId. For example, in PK business, you can initiate relay through startPublishMediaStream first, then use taskId and this interface to update the relay to a transcoding task when the anchor initiates PK. At this time, CDN playback will be continuous and without stream disconnection (you need to keep the media stream encoding output parameters consistent).
> 

> 3. The same task does not support switching between Audio Only, Audio and Video, and Pure Video.
> 

## stopPublishMediaStream:

This interface will send directives to the TRTC server to stop the media stream started by startPublishMediaStream
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| taskId | It will provide you with the task identifier (i.e., taskId) for the background start task through the onStartPublishMediaStream callback |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. If your business backend has not saved the taskId, after your host re-enters the room following an abnormal exit, you can call startPublishMediaStream again to start the task. TRTC backend will return a task start failure and provide you with the taskId from the last attempt
> 

> 2. If the taskId is an empty string, all media streams started by startPublishMediaStream for that user will stop. If you have only started one media stream or want to stop all media streams you started, this method is recommended.
> 

## startLocalPreview:view:

#### Enable the preview screen of the local camera (Mobile Terminal)

Call this function before enterRoom. The SDK will only enable the camera and wait until you call enterRoom to start streaming.

Call this function after enterRoom. The SDK will enable the camera and automatically begin video streaming. You will receive an onCameraDidReady callback notification in TRTCCloudDelegate when the first frame of the camera is rendered.
| Parameters | Description |

## updateLocalView:

#### Update the preview screen of the local camera

## stopLocalPreview

#### Stop camera preview

## muteLocalVideo:mute:

#### Suspend/Resume publishing local video stream

This interface can suspend (or recover) the publishing of local video screens. After suspension, other users in the same room will not be able to see your screen.

This interface is equivalent to start/stopLocalPreview when specifying TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig, but has better response speed.

Because start/stopLocalPreview requires turning on and off the camera, and turning on and off the camera is a hardware-related operation, which is very time-consuming.

In comparison, muteLocalVideo only needs to suspend or pass the data stream at the software layer. Therefore, it is more efficient and more suitable for scenarios requiring frequent openings and closings.

When suspending/recovering the publishing of the specified TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig, other users in the same room will receive the onUserVideoAvailable callback notification.

When suspending/recovering the publishing of the specified TRTCVideoStreamTypeSub, other users in the same room will receive the onUserSubStreamAvailable callback notification.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mute | YES: Suspension; NO: Recovery. |
| streamType | The video stream type to be suspended/recovered (only supports TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig and TRTCVideoStreamTypeSub). |

## setVideoMuteImage:fps:

#### Set the alternative image during the suspension of the local screen

When you call muteLocalVideo(YES) to suspend the local screen, you can set an alternative image through this interface. After setting, other users in the room will see this alternative image instead of a black screen.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| fps | Set the frame rate for the alternative image, with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 10. The default is 5. |
| image | Set the alternative image. A null value means no video stream data will be sent after muteLocalVideo. The default is null. |

## startRemoteView:streamType:view:

#### Subscribe to the video stream of a remote user and bind the video rendering control

By calling this API, the SDK can pull the video stream of the specified user ID and render it on the rendering control specified by the parameter view. You can set the display mode of the screen through setRemoteRenderParams.
-  If you already know the user ID of a user who has a video stream in the room, you can directly call startRemoteView to subscribe to that user's video feed.

-  If you do not know which users in the room are publishing video, you can wait for a notification from onUserVideoAvailable after entering the room.

Calling this API only starts pulling the video stream, at this point the screen still needs to load and buffer. When buffering is complete, you will receive a notification from onFirstVideoFrame.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| streamType | Specify the type of video stream of the user you want to watch. -  High-definition main stream: TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig. -  Low-definition substream: TRTCVideoStreamTypeSmall (effective only when the remote user has enabled dual-stream encoding through enableEncSmallVideoStream). -  Substream (commonly used for screen sharing): TRTCVideoStreamTypeSub. |
| userId | Specify the remote user's ID. |
| view | Rendering control used to display the video screen. |

> **Note**
> 

> Note a few rules:
> 

> 1. The SDK supports watching the main stream and substream of a certain user ID simultaneously, or watching the substream and small stream of a certain user ID simultaneously, but does not support watching the main stream and small stream simultaneously.
> 

> 2. You can only watch the small stream of the specified user ID when dual-stream encoding is enabled through enableEncSmallVideoStream.
> 

> 3. When the small stream of the specified user ID does not exist, the SDK will default to the user's main stream.

## setGravitySensorAdaptiveMode:

#### Set gravity sensing adaptive mode (11.7 and above)

After gravity sensing is enabled, if the collection end device rotates, both the collection end and audience side will render the image accordingly to ensure the image in the view is always upright.

It only takes effect in the SDK internal camera capture scene and only works on the mobile terminal.

1. This interface only affects the collection end. If you are just watching the image in the room, enabling this interface is ineffective

2. When the collection end device rotates 90 degrees or 270 degrees, the image seen by the collection end or audience side may be cropped to maintain aspect ratio coordination
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mode | Gravity sensing mode. For details, see TRTCGravitySensorAdaptiveMode_Disable, TRTCGravitySensorAdaptiveMode_FillByCenterCrop, and TRTCGravitySensorAdaptiveMode_FitWithBlackBorder. Default value: TRTCGravitySensorAdaptiveMode_Disable. |

## startLocalAudio:

#### Enable collection and publishing of local audio

The SDK does not enable the microphone by default. When users need to publish local audio, they need to call this interface to enable microphone collection and encoding and publish the audio to the current room.

After enabling the collection and publishing of local audio, other users in the room will receive a onUserAudioAvailable(userId, YES) notification.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| quality | Sound quality - TRTCAudioQualitySpeech, Fluent: Sample rate: 16k; Mono; Audio bitrate: 16kbps; Suitable for voice call-dominated scenarios, such as online meetings and voice calls. - TRTCAudioQualityDefault, Default: Sample rate: 48k; Mono; Audio bitrate: 50kbps; The default audio quality of the SDK, recommended unless there are special requirements. - TRTCAudioQualityMusic, High Quality: Sample rate: 48k; Stereo + full band; Audio bitrate: 128kbps; Suitable for high-fidelity music transmission scenarios, such as online KTV and music live streaming. |

> **Note**
> 

> This function checks the microphone permissions. If the current app does not have microphone permissions, the SDK will automatically request microphone permissions from the user.
> 

## stopLocalAudio

#### Stop collection and publishing of local audio

After stopping the collection and publishing of local audio, other users in the room will receive a onUserAudioAvailable(userId, NO) notification.

## muteLocalAudio:

#### Pause/Resume publishing of the local audio stream

After you pause the publication of the local audio stream, other users in the room will receive a notification onUserAudioAvailable(userId, NO).

After you resume the publication of the local audio stream, other users in the room will receive a notification onUserAudioAvailable(userId, YES).

The difference from stopLocalAudio is that muteLocalAudio(YES) does not release the microphone permission but continues to send extremely low bitrate mute packets.

This is very suitable for scenarios that require cloud recording because video files in formats like MP4 demand high continuity of audio data, and using stopLocalAudio will make the recorded MP4 files difficult to play.

Therefore, in scenarios where the quality of the recorded files is highly required, it is recommended to choose muteLocalAudio instead of stopLocalAudio.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mute | YES: Mute; NO: Resume. |

In online education scenarios, teachers can use this feature to allow the SDK to capture the audio from educational videos and broadcast it to students in the same room.

In music live streaming scenarios, the host can use this feature to allow the SDK to capture audio from the music player to add background music to their live stream.

> **Note**
> 

> 1. This feature requires the installation of a virtual audio device plugin on the user's Mac system. Once installed, the SDK will capture audio from the installed virtual audio device.
> 

> 2. The SDK will automatically download and install the appropriate plugins from the internet. However, the download speed may be slow. To speed up this process, you can package the virtual audio plugin file into your App Bundle's Resources directory.

## startScreenCapture:streamType:encParam:

#### Start Screen Sharing

This interface can capture the entire screen content or the content of a specific application window you designate, sharing it with other users in the same room.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| encParam | Screen Sharing Encoding Parameters: The SDK prioritizes the encoding parameters you set through this interface -  If you set encParam to null and have set substream video encoding parameters through setSubStreamEncoderParam, the SDK will use those parameters for screen sharing. -  If you set encParam to null and have not set substream video encoding parameters through setSubStreamEncoderParam, the SDK will automatically select the best encoding parameters for screen sharing. |
| streamType | The circuit used for screen sharing can be set to Main Road (TRTCVideoStreamTypeBig) or Auxiliary Road (TRTCVideoStreamTypeSub), with the auxiliary road being recommended. |
| view | The parent control of the rendering control can be set to null, indicating that the preview effect of screen sharing will not be displayed. |

> 

## enableCustomAudioCapture:

#### Enable Custom Audio Capturing Mode

After enabling this mode, the SDK will no longer run the original audio capture process, meaning it will stop capturing audio data from the microphone and only retain audio encoding and sending capabilities.

You need to continuously feed the SDK with your own collected audio data through sendCustomAudioData.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enable | Whether to enable it, default value: NO. |

> **Note**
> 

> As Echo Cancellation (AEC) requires strict control over the timing of audio capture and playback, enabling custom audio capture may result in AEC capabilities becoming ineffective.

## enableMixExternalAudioFrame:playout:

#### Enable/Disable Custom Audio Track

Once enabled, you can use this interface to mix a Custom Audio Track into the SDK. With two boolean parameters, you can control whether the track should play remotely and locally.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enablePlayout | Control whether the mixed track should play locally. Default: NO. |
| enablePublish | Control whether the mixed track should play remotely. Default: NO. |

> **Note**
> 

> If you specify both parameters enablePublish and enablePlayout as NO, it means completely disabling your Custom Audio Track.
> 

## mixExternalAudioFrame:

#### Mix Custom Audio Track into the SDK

Before calling this interface, you need to enable the Custom Audio Track with enableMixExternalAudioFrame first. After that, you can use this interface to mix your own audio track into the SDK in PCM format.

Ideally, we expect your code to provide track data to the SDK at a very consistent rate. However, we understand that maintaining perfect call intervals is a significant challenge.

Therefore, the SDK will initiate a buffer for audio track data internally. This buffer acts like a "reservoir", capable of temporarily storing the audio track data you input, smoothing out the jitter caused by intervals between interface calls.

The return value of this interface represents the size of this track buffer zone, measured in milliseconds (ms). For example: if this interface returns 50, it means the current track buffer zone has 50ms worth of track data. Therefore, as long as you call this interface again within 50ms, the SDK can ensure the continuity of your mixed track data.

When you call this interface, if you find the return value > 100ms, you can wait for one frame of audio playback time before calling again; if the return value < 100ms, it means the buffer is relatively small, you can mix in some more audio track data to ensure the size of the audio track buffer remains above the "safe level".

Parameter TRTCAudioFrame is recommended to be filled as follows (other fields do not need to be filled):
-  data: Audio frame buffer. Audio frame data only supports PCM format, with frame lengths ranging from [5ms ~ 100ms]. A frame length of 20ms is recommended. Calculation method: [48000 sampling rate, mono channel frame length: 48000 × 0.02s × 1 × 16bit = 15360bit = 1920 bytes].

-  sampleRate: Sampling rate, supported values are 16000, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000.

-  channel: Number of channels (if stereo, data is interleaved), mono: 1; stereo: 2.

-  timestamp: Timestamp, in milliseconds (ms). Please use the timestamp recorded when the audio frame is captured (you can get the timestamp by calling generateCustomPTS after capturing an audio frame).

| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| frame | Audio Data |

> **Note**
> 

> Please call this interface accurately at intervals corresponding to the duration of each frame. Feeding data at uneven intervals is likely to cause audio stutter.
> 

#### Return value description:

>= 0 Buffered length, unit: ms. < 0 Error (-1 mixExternalAudioFrame not enabled)

## setMixExternalAudioVolume:playoutVolume:

#### Set the Streaming Volume and Playback Volume for External Audio Mixed During Streaming
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| playoutVolume | Set the playback volume level, ranging from 0 to 100. -1 means no change. |
| publishVolume | Set the streaming volume level, ranging from 0 to 100. -1 means no change. |

## generateCustomPTS

#### Generate Timestamp for Custom Capturing

This interface is only applicable to custom capturing mode, used to solve the issue of audio and video out of sync caused by the discrepancy between capture time and delivery time.

When you use interfaces such as sendCustomVideoData or sendCustomAudioData for custom video or audio capturing, please follow these steps to use this interface:

1. First, when capturing a video or audio frame, call this interface to obtain the PTS timestamp of that moment.

2. Then, you can send the video or audio frame to the preprocessing module you use (such as third-party beauty components or third-party audio effect components).

3. When actually calling sendCustomVideoData or sendCustomAudioData for streaming, please assign the PTS timestamp recorded during capture to the timestamp field in TRTCVideoFrame or TRTCAudioFrame.

## sendSEIMsg:repeatCount:

#### Sends a custom message using SEI channel to all users in a room

This interface allows you to broadcast self-defined data to other users in the current room using TRTC's SEI channel to achieve signaling transmission.

There is a header data block called SEI in the video frame header. The principle of this interface is to use this SEI header data block to embed the self-defined signaling you want to send, so it is sent out along with the video frame.

Therefore, compared to sendCustomCmdMsg, signaling transmitted via the SEI channel has better compatibility: the signaling can be transmitted along with the video frame all the way to the live CDN.

However, because the data block in the video frame header cannot be too large, it is recommended to control the signaling size to just a few bytes when using this interface.

The most common usage is to embed a self-defined timestamp (timestamp) into the video frame using this interface to achieve perfect alignment of messages and screen (e.g., in educational scenarios for aligning courseware and video signals).

Other users in the room can receive messages via the onRecvSEIMsg callback in TRTCCloudDelegate.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| data | Data to be sent, which can contain up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes) of data |
| repeatCount | Number of data sends |

> **Note**
> 

> This interface has the following limitations:
> 

> 1. Data will not be sent immediately after the API invocation, but will be sent along with the next video frame.
> 

> 2. Send messages to all users in the room, up to 30 messages per second (shared limit with sendCustomCmdMsg).
> 

> 3. Each package is a maximum of 1 KB. Sending large amounts of data will increase the video bitrate and possibly cause reduced image quality or lag (shared limit with sendCustomCmdMsg).
> 

> 4. Each client can send up to 8 KB of data per second (shared limit with sendCustomCmdMsg).
> 

> 5. If multiple sends are specified (repeatCount > 1), the data will be sent with the subsequent repeatCount number of video frames, which will also increase the video bitrate.
> 

> 6. If repeatCount > 1 and there are multiple sends, the onRecvSEIMsg callback may receive the same message multiple times, and deduplication is needed.
> 

#### Return value description:

YES: The message has passed the limit and is waiting to be sent in subsequent video frames; NO: The message is restricted from being sent

## startSpeedTest:

#### Start internet speed test (use before entering the room)
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| params | Speed Test Options |

> **Note**
> 

> 1. The speed test process will incur a small basic service fee. For details, refer to [Billing Overview > Basic Service](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/17157#.E5.9F.BA.E7.A1.80.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1) documentation.
> 

> 2. Please perform the internet speed test before entering the room. Conducting the test in the room will affect normal audio and video transmission and will also be inaccurate due to too much interference.
> 

> 3. Only one internet speed test task is allowed to run at the same time.
> 

#### Return value description:

API Invocation Result, < 0: Failure

## stopSpeedTest

#### Stops network speed testing

## getSDKVersion

#### Obtains the SDK version.

## setLogLevel:

#### Sets the log output level.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| level | Refer to TRTCLogLevel, default value: TRTCLogLevelNone |

## setConsoleEnabled:

#### Enables/Disables console log print.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enabled | Specify whether to enable it. Default: Disabled. |

## setLogCompressEnabled:

#### Enables/Disables local log compression

After enabling compression, the log storage volume is significantly reduced, but you need to use a Python script provided by Tencent Cloud to decompress and read it.

After disabling compression, logs are stored in plaintext, which can be opened and read directly with Notepad but occupy more space.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enabled | Specify whether to enable it. Default: Enabled |

## setLogDirPath:

#### Sets the save path for local logs

This interface allows you to change the default storage path of SDK local logs. The default local log storage locations are:
-  Windows platform: C:/Users/[system username]/AppData/Roaming/liteav/log, i.e., %appdata%/liteav/log.

-  iOS or Mac platform: sandbox Documents/log.

-  Android platform: /app private directory/files/log/liteav/.

| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| path | Storage path for logs |

> **Note**
> 

> Make sure to call this before all other interfaces and ensure that the specified directory exists and that your application has read and write permissions for that directory.
> 

## setLogDelegate:

#### Log callback

## showDebugView:

#### Show Dashboard

The "Dashboard" is a semi-transparent debug information overlay located above the video rendering control, used to display audio and video information and event information, aiding in integration and debugging.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| showType | 0: Do not display; 1: Display simplified edition (audio and video information only); 2: Display full version (including audio and video information and event information). |

## setDebugViewMargin:margin:

#### Set the dashboard margin

Used to adjust the position of the dashboard within the video rendering control. Must be called before showDebugView to take effect.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| margin | Dashboard inner padding. Note that here it is based on the percentage of the parentView. Margin value range is 0 - 1. |
| userId | User ID. |

## callExperimentalAPI:

#### Calls an experimental API.

## enablePayloadPrivateEncryption:params:

#### Enable or disable media stream private encryption

In scenarios with high security requirements, TRTC recommends calling the enablePayloadPrivateEncryption method to enable media stream private encryption before joining a room.

After the user leaves the room, the SDK will automatically disable private encryption. If you need to re-enable private encryption, you must call this method before the user rejoins the room.
| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config | For configuring the media stream private encryption algorithm and key, refer to TRTCPayloadPrivateEncryptionConfig. |
| enabled | Whether to enable media stream private encryption. |

> **Note**
> 

> TRTC already encrypts media streams before transmission. When media stream private encryption is enabled, it will use the key and initialization vector you provided for additional encryption.
>
