This document guides you on how to use Atomicx to implement screen sharing capabilities and handle room interactions based on screen sharing status.

## Prerequisites
- The user has completed login authentication through [useLoginState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#module-LoginState), please refer to Integration Overview.

- The user has entered a room through [useRoomState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#module-RoomState), please refer to Room Management.

- If integrating in `iframe`, permissions need to be declared in the tag.

   ``` typescript
   <iframe allow="display-capture; fullscreen;"></iframe>
   ```

## Implementing Screen Sharing Feature

### Step 1: Start Screen Sharing

Use the [startScreenShare](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#startScreenShare) method to start screen sharing. In the Web environment, you will see the browser's screen selector where you can choose to share the entire screen, application window, or browser tab.

``` typescript
import { useDeviceState } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';
const { startScreenShare } = useDeviceState();

// Try to start screen sharing and attempt to share system audio
const handleStartShare = async () => {
  try {
    await startScreenShare({ screenAudio: true });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors such as user rejection or browser not supporting
    console.error('Failed to start screen sharing:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Share System Audio

By setting the `screenAudio: true` parameter, you can share system audio while screen sharing. This is very useful when sharing videos, presentations, music, and other audio content.

``` typescript
import { useDeviceState } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';
const { startScreenShare } = useDeviceState();

// Start screen sharing and share system audio
const handleStartScreenShareWithAudio = async () => {
  try {
    await startScreenShare({ screenAudio: true });
    console.log('Screen sharing (with audio) started');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start screen sharing:', error);
  }
};
```

**Browser Compatibility Notes:**
| Browser | System Audio Sharing Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome 74+ | Supported | Need to check **Share audio** in selector |
| Edge 79+ | Supported | Based on Chromium, same experience as Chrome |
| Firefox | Not Supported | System audio sharing not supported yet |
| Safari | Not Supported | System audio sharing not supported yet |

> **Note:**
> 

> System audio sharing requires browser support, and users need to check the **Share audio** option in the screen selector. If the browser doesn't support system audio sharing, the `screenAudio` parameter will be ignored, but screen video sharing will work normally.
> 

### Step 3: Stop Screen Sharing

Users can stop screen sharing through the following methods:
1. **Call the **[**stopScreenShare()**](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#stopScreenShare)** interface**

   ``` typescript
   import { useDeviceState, DeviceStatus } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';
   const { screenStatus, stopScreenShare } = useDeviceState();
   
   // Stop screen sharing
   const handleStopScreenShare = async () => {
     try {
       await stopScreenShare();
       console.log('Screen sharing stopped');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to stop screen sharing:', error);
     }
   };
   ```
2. **Click the browser's native "Stop sharing" button**

   

3. **Close the shared window or tab**
   

   > **Note:**
   > 

   > When users stop screen sharing using any method, Atomicx will automatically update the [screenStatus](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#screenStatus) state.
   > 

### Step 4: Permission Control and State Listening

#### **Set Screen Sharing Permissions**

You can control screen management permissions in the room through member management interfaces provided by [useRoomParticipantState](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/live/web/doc/zh/index.html#module-RoomParticipantState).
``` typescript
import { useRoomParticipantState, DeviceType } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';
const { disableAllDevices } = useRoomParticipantState();

// Restrict screen sharing to only room owner/admin
async function handleDisableAllScreen() {
  await disableAllDevices({
    deviceType: DeviceType.Screen,
    disable: true,
  });
}

// Allow all users in the room to initiate screen sharing
async function handleEnableAllScreen() {
  await disableAllDevices({
    deviceType: DeviceType.Screen,
    disable: false,
  });
}
```

#### **Automatic Layout Switching**

When detecting that a user in the room has started screen sharing, it is recommended to switch to sidebar layout (`RoomLayoutTemplate.SidebarLayout`), enlarging the shared screen while displaying other participants' screens in the sidebar.
``` typescript
<template>
  <div class="room-container">
    <RoomView :layout-template="layoutTemplate">
      <template #participantViewUI="{ participant, streamType }">
        <ParticipantViewUI 
          :participant="participant" 
          :stream-type="streamType" 
        />
      </template>
    </RoomView>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';
import { 
  RoomView, 
  RoomLayoutTemplate,
  useRoomParticipantState
} from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';

const layoutTemplate = ref(RoomLayoutTemplate.GridLayout);
const { participantWithScreen } = useRoomParticipantState();

// Listen for screen sharing state and automatically switch layout
watch(participantWithScreen, (participant) => {
  if (participant) {
    // Someone is sharing screen, switch to sidebar layout
    layoutTemplate.value = RoomLayoutTemplate.SidebarLayout;
  } else {
    // No one is sharing screen, switch back to grid layout
    layoutTemplate.value = RoomLayoutTemplate.GridLayout;
  }
});
</script>
```

#### **Restrict to One Person Screen Sharing**

Only one person should be allowed to share screen in a room. When someone is sharing, disable other users' share buttons:
``` typescript
<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue';
import { useRoomParticipantState } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';

const { participantWithScreen, localParticipant } = useRoomParticipantState();

const isOtherSharing = computed(() => {
  const sharer = participantWithScreen.value;
  if (!sharer) return false;
  return sharer.userId !== localParticipant.value?.userId;
});

const canStartScreenShare = computed(() => {
  return !isOtherSharing.value;
});
</script>

// Use in template
<template>
  <button :disabled="!canStartScreenShare" @click="handleStartShare">
    Start Screen Sharing
  </button>
<template>
```

### Step 5: Handle Screen Sharing Errors

When screen sharing encounters errors, provide appropriate prompts to users based on error messages.

**Code Example:**
``` typescript
import { useDeviceState, DeviceError } from 'tuikit-atomicx-vue3/room';
import { TUIToast } from '@tencentcloud/uikit-base-component-vue3';

const { startScreenShare } = useDeviceState();

try {
  await startScreenShare();
} catch (error: any) {
  let message = '';
  switch (error.name) {
    case 'NotReadableError':
      message = 'System prohibits current browser from accessing screen content, please enable screen sharing permission.';
      break;
    case 'NotAllowedError':
      if (error.message.includes('Permission denied by system')) {
        message = 'System prohibits current browser from accessing screen content, please enable screen sharing permission.';
      } else {
        message = 'User cancelled screen sharing';
      }
      break;
    default:
      message = 'Unknown error occurred during screen sharing, please try again.';
      break;
  }
  TUIToast.warning({
    message,
  });
}
```

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't system audio sharing work?
- **Platform Restriction:** Audio sharing is currently only supported on modern browsers like Chrome and Edge.

- **Operational Details:** Users must manually select **Share audio** in the browser's screen selector.

- **System Restriction:** Some operating systems do not support sharing audio from specific **application windows**. It is recommended to prioritize selecting **entire screen** or **browser tab**.

### How to detect when users stop screen sharing by clicking the browser's "Stop sharing" button?

Atomicx automatically listens for the browser's stop sharing event and updates the `screenStatus` state. You just need to listen for changes in `screenStatus`:
``` typescript
watch(screenStatus, (newStatus, oldStatus) => {
  if (oldStatus === DeviceStatus.On && newStatus === DeviceStatus.Off) {
    console.log('User has stopped screen sharing.');
  }
});
```

### Do mobile browsers support screen sharing?

Only desktop browsers support screen sharing. Mobile browsers do not support screen sharing capabilities.

### Why does the user's microphone status display as "on" when they enable screen sharing audio?

This is expected system behavior for the following reasons:

**Technical Principle:**`microphoneStatus` indicates whether the current device is transmitting audio signals externally. When screen sharing is enabled and **system audio capture is checked**, Atomicx SDK will start an audio transmission channel. Since the remote end receives a continuous audio data stream, the system cannot distinguish whether the audio source is from a physical microphone or system playback sound, so the audio capture status is uniformly marked as `DeviceStatus.On`.

**Privacy Note:** Please rest assured, this does not mean your microphone is capturing voice. Whether the microphone voice is being pushed is only related to microphone control interfaces (`openLocalMicrophone` and `unmuteLocalMicrophone`), and is independent of screen sharing audio capture. Even if screen sharing audio is being transmitted, as long as microphone-related interfaces are not called, your microphone voice will not be captured and pushed.
