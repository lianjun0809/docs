**AtomicXCore** provides the [CoGuestStore](https://tencent-rtc.github.io/TUIKit_iOS/documentation/atomicxcore/cogueststore) module, purpose-built to manage the complete audience co-hosting workflow. You do not need to handle complex state synchronization or signaling logic—simply call a few intuitive methods to add robust audio and video interaction between viewers and hosts in your live stream.

## Core Features

`CoGuestStore` supports the two most common co-hosting scenarios:
- **Audience Request to Join**: An audience member initiates a co-hosting request, and the host can accept or reject it.

- **Host Invites to Join**: The host can invite any audience member in the live room to co-host.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Component Integration

Refer to [Quick Start](https://write.woa.com/document/194571606121816064) to integrate AtomicXCore and complete the setup of `LiveCoreView`.

### Step 2: Implement Audience Request to Join

#### Audience-Side Implementation

As an audience member, your primary tasks are to **initiate a request, handle the host's response, and leave the seat when desired.**
1. **Initiate a Co-hosting Request**


   When the user taps the "Request to Join" button, call the `applyForSeat` method.

   ``` swift
   import AtomicXCore
   
   let liveId = "Room ID"
   let guestStore = CoGuestStore.create(liveID: liveId)
   
   // User taps "Request to Co-host"
   func requestToConnect() {
       // timeout: Request timeout duration, e.g., 30 seconds
       guestStore.applyForSeat(timeout: 30.0, extraInfo: nil) { result in
         switch result {
         case .success():
             print("Co-hosting request sent, waiting for host response...")
         case .failure(let error):
             print("Failed to send request: \(error.message)")
         }
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Listen for Host Response**


   Subscribe to `guestEventPublisher` to receive the host's response.

   ``` swift
   // Subscribe to events during your view controller's initialization
   func subscribeGuestEvents() {
       guestStore.guestEventPublisher
         .sink { [weak self] event in
             if case let .onGuestApplicationResponded(isAccept, hostUser) = event {
                 if isAccept {
                     print("Host \(hostUser.userName) accepted your request, preparing to go live")
                     // 1. Enable camera and microphone
                     DeviceStore.shared.openLocalCamera(isFront: true, completion: nil)
                     DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone(completion: nil)
                     // 2. Update UI, e.g., disable the request button and show co-hosting status
                 } else {
                     print("Host \(hostUser.userName) rejected your request")
                     // Show a popup to notify the user that the request was rejected
                 }
             }
         }
         .store(in: &cancellables) // Manage subscription lifecycle
   }
   ```
3. **Leave the Seat**


   When a co-hosting audience member wants to end the interaction, call the `disConnect` method to return to audience status.

   ``` swift
   // User taps "Leave Mic" button
   func leaveSeat() {
       guestStore.disConnect { result in
         switch result {
         case .success():
             print("Successfully left the mic")
         case .failure(let error):
             print("Failed to leave the mic: \(error.message)")
         }
       }
   }
   ```
4. **(Optional) Cancel Request**


   If the audience member wants to withdraw the request before the host responds, call `cancelApplication`.

   ``` swift
   // User taps "Cancel Request" while waiting
   func cancelRequest() {
       guestStore.cancelApplication { result in
         switch result {
         case .success():
             print("Request cancelled")
         case .failure(let error):
             print("Failed to cancel request: \(error.message)")
         }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Host-Side Implementation

As a host, your main responsibilities are to **receive requests, display the applicant list, and process requests**.
1. **Listen for New Co-hosting Requests**


   Subscribe to `hostEventPublisher` to be notified when a new audience member requests to co-host.

   ``` swift
   import AtomicXCore
   
   let liveId = "Room ID"
   let guestStore = CoGuestStore.create(liveID: liveId)
   
   // Subscribe to host events
   guestStore.hostEventPublisher
       .sink { [weak self] event in
           if case let .onGuestApplicationReceived(guestUser) = event {
               print("Received co-hosting request from audience member \(guestUser.userName)")
               // Update UI, e.g., show a red dot on the "Request List" button
           }
       }
       .store(in: &cancellables)
   ```
2. **Display Request List**


   `CoGuestStore` maintains the current list of applicants in real time. Subscribe to this list to update your UI.

   ``` swift
   // Subscribe to state changes
   guestStore.state
       .subscribe(StatePublisherSelector(keyPath: \CoGuestState.applicants)) // Only observe changes to the applicant list
       .removeDuplicates()
       .sink { applicants in
           print("Current number of applicants: \(applicants.count)")
           // Refresh your "Applicant List" UI here
           // self.applicantListView.update(with: applicants)
       }
       .store(in: &cancellables)
   ```
3. **Process Co-hosting Requests**


   When you select an audience member and choose "Accept" or "Reject", call the corresponding method.

   ``` swift
   // Host taps "Accept" button, passing in the applicant's userID
   func accept(userId: String) {
       guestStore.acceptApplication(userID: userId) { result in
           if case .success = result {
               print("Accepted \(userId)'s request, they are joining as a co-host")
           }
       }
   }
   
   // Host taps "Reject" button
   func reject(userId: String) {
       guestStore.rejectApplication(userID: userId) { result in
           if case .success = result {
               print("Rejected \(userId)'s request")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Implement Host Inviting Audience to Join the Stage

#### Host-Side Implementation
1. **Send Invitation to Audience**


   When the host selects an audience member and taps "Invite to Co-host", call the `inviteToSeat` method.

   ``` swift
   // Host selects an audience member and sends an invite
   func invite(userId: String) {
       // timeout: Invitation timeout duration
       guestStore.inviteToSeat(userID: userId, timeout: 30.0, extraInfo: nil) { result in
           if case .success = result {
               print("Invitation sent to \(userId), waiting for their response...")
           }
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Listen for Audience Response**


   Listen for the `onHostInvitationResponded` event via `hostEventPublisher`.

   ``` swift
   // Add this in the hostEventPublisher subscription
   if case let .onHostInvitationResponded(isAccept, guestUser) = event {
       if isAccept {
           print("Audience member \(guestUser.userName) accepted your invitation")
       } else {
           print("Audience member \(guestUser.userName) rejected your invitation")
       }
   }
   ```

#### Audience-Side Implementation
1. **Receive Host Invitation**


   Listen for the `onHostInvitationReceived` event via `guestEventPublisher`.

   ``` swift
   // Add this in the guestEventPublisher subscription
   if case let .onHostInvitationReceived(hostUser) = event {
       print("Received co-hosting invitation from host \(hostUser.userName)")
       // Show a dialog to let the user choose "Accept" or "Reject"
       // self.showInvitationDialog(from: hostUser)
   }
   ```
2. **Respond to Invitation**


   After the user makes a selection, call the corresponding method.

   ``` swift
   let inviterId = "Inviting host's ID" // Obtain from the onHostInvitationReceived event
   
   // User taps "Accept"
   func accept() {
       guestStore.acceptInvitation(inviterID: inviterId) { result in
           if case .success = result {
               // Enable camera and microphone
               DeviceStore.shared.openLocalCamera(isFront: true, completion: nil)
               DeviceStore.shared.openLocalMicrophone(completion: nil)
           }
       }
   }
   
   // User taps "Reject"
   func reject() {
       guestStore.rejectInvitation(inviterID: inviterId) { result in
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

### Run and Test

After integrating the above features, use two audience members and a host to test co-hosting. For example, Audience A enables both camera and microphone, while Audience B enables only the microphone. The result is shown below. For UI customization, see [Refining UI Details](https://write.woa.com/#736c00b3-02dc-494b-838d-226439fd3e15).

![](https://write-document-release-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.tencentcos.cn/100027182498/da12f5cec6de11f09e745254007c27c5.png)


## Refining UI Details

Use the "slot" capability provided by the `LiveCoreView.VideoViewDelegate` protocol to add custom views on top of the co-host video stream. For example, display the user's nickname, avatar, or a placeholder image when the camera is off to enhance the visual experience.

### Displaying Nicknames on Video Streams

#### Implementation Example

![](https://write-document-release-1258344699.cos.ap-guangzhou.tencentcos.cn/100027182498/f94d5741c6de11f0aedb525400454e06.png)


#### Implementation Steps

> **Note：**
> 

> For complete implementation details, refer to the open-source TUILiveKit project files [AnchorCoGuestView.swift](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIKit_iOS/blob/main/live/Sources/Features/AnchorBoardcast/View/LivingView/Video/AnchorCoGuestView.swift) and [AnchorEmptySeatView.swift](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIKit_iOS/blob/main/live/Sources/Features/AnchorBoardcast/View/LivingView/Video/AnchorEmptySeatView.swift).
> 

- **Step 1**: Create the foreground view `CustomSeatView` to display user info above the video stream.

   ``` swift
   import UIKit
   
   // Custom floating user info view (foreground)
   class CustomSeatView: UIView {
      lazy var nameLabel: UILabel = {
           let label = UILabel()
           label.textColor = .white
           label.font = .systemFont(ofSize: 14)
           return label
       }()
   
       override init(frame: CGRect) {
           super.init(frame: frame)
           backgroundColor = UIColor.black.withAlphaComponent(0.5)
           addSubview(nameLabel)
           nameLabel.snp.makeConstraints { make in
               make.bottom.equalToSuperview().offset(-5)
               make.leading.equalToSuperview().offset(5)
           }
       }
   }
   ```
- **Step 2**: Create the background view `CustomAvatarView` to serve as a placeholder when the user has no video stream.

   ``` swift
   import UIKit
   
   // Custom avatar placeholder view (background)
   class CustomAvatarView: UIView {
       lazy var avatarImageView: UIImageView = {
           let imageView = UIImageView()
           imageView.tintColor = .gray
           return imageView
       }()
   
       override init(frame: CGRect) {
           super.init(frame: frame)
           backgroundColor = .clear
           layer.cornerRadius = 30
           addSubview(avatarImageView)
           avatarImageView.snp.makeConstraints { make in
               make.center.equalToSuperview()
               make.width.height.equalTo(60)
           }
       }
   }
   ```
- **Step 3**: Implement the `VideoViewDelegate.createCoGuestView` protocol method, returning the appropriate view based on the `viewLayer` value.

   ``` swift
   import AtomicXCore
   
   // 1. In your view controller, conform to the VideoViewDelegate protocol
   class YourViewController: UIViewController, VideoViewDelegate {
   
       // ... other code ...
   
       // 2. Implement the protocol method to handle both viewLayer types
       func createCoGuestView(seatInfo: TUISeatFullInfo, viewLayer: ViewLayer) -> UIView? {
           guard let userId = seatInfo.userID, !userId.isEmpty else {
               return nil
           }
           if viewLayer == .foreground {
               // When the user's camera is on, display the foreground view
               let seatView = CustomSeatView()
               seatView.nameLabel.text = seatInfo.userName
               return seatView
           } else { // viewLayer == .background
               // When the user's camera is off, display the background view
               let avatarView = CustomAvatarView()
               // Load the user's avatar here using seatInfo.userAvatar if available
               return avatarView
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## FAQs

### How do I manage the lifecycle and events of custom views added via `VideoViewDelegate`?

`LiveCoreView` automatically manages the addition and removal of views returned by your adapter methods. You do not need to handle this manually. To support user interactions (such as click events) in your custom view, add the appropriate event listeners when creating the view.

### What is the purpose of the viewLayer parameter in VideoViewAdapter?

The viewLayer parameter distinguishes between foreground and background widgets:
- `.foreground`: Foreground layer, always displayed on top of the video.

- `.background`: Background layer, displayed only when the user has no video stream (e.g., camera is off); typically used to show the user's avatar or a placeholder image.


### Why is my custom view not showing up?
- **Check adapter settings**: Ensure you have called `coreView.videoViewDelegate = self` and set the adapter successfully.

- **Check implementation method**: Confirm that you have correctly implemented the relevant adapter method (such as `createCoGuestView`).

- **Check return value**: Make sure your adapter method returns a valid `UIView` instance at the appropriate time, not null. Add logs in the adapter method for debugging if needed.
